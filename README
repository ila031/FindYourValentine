This website allows individuals to find a valentine (a person to spend the day with) in the matter of minutes.
You answer a questionare when you sign up and it matches that with other users who line up pwith your choices
The gives you choices that you can explore and who you want to engae with.
From that you can reach out throuugh the website to take to that individual to feel it out.


How I would continue with this project:
Is creating that storage and data base were users can actually connect with other users with safety and security.
Creating and finishing that message portal thats very limited so that users can use the website to converse and 
feel each other out before moving on.
Add in more functions(that creates better user expirence.)

HTML AND CSS was used.

NOTES: Photo on home page in the middle will represent the matches profile
The photo on the right will be off the users.

Functions;
Main html -> Log in page
sign up and sign up2 -> collect info and have the questionare
home -> is the home page (that in the future will need to be revamped)
